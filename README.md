### Live Testing with Hot Reloading

Preface retail version supports **hot reloading** for shaders! This means you can:

- Download Preface [from Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2820060/Preface_Undiscovered_World/) (for free)!
- Edit the shaders directly in your favorite editor.
- See the changes applied in real-time without a restart.

This feature makes it easy to tweak and perfect your shader effects without restarting.
